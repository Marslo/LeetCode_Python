## Question

<blockquote>
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. <br>

Examples:<br>
Given <code>"abcabcbb"</code>, the answer is <code>"abc"</code>, which the length is <code>3</code>.<br>

Given <code>"bbbbb"</code>, the answer is <code>"b"</code>, with the length of <code>1</code>.<br>

Given <code>"pwwkew"</code>, the answer is <code>"wke"</code>, with the length of <code>3</code>. Note that the answer must be a substring, <code>"pwke"</code> is a subsequence and not a substring.<br>

## Solution

### Approach #1 Brute Force [Time Limit Exceeded]
#### Intuition
Check all the substring one by one to see if it has no duplicate character.

#### Algorithm

Suppose we have a function `boolean allUnique(String substring)` which will return true if the characters in the substring are all unique, otherwise false. We can iterate through all the possible substrings of the given string `s` and call the function `allUnique`. If it turns out to be true, then we update our answer of the maximum length of substring without duplicate characters.

Now let's fill the missing parts:

* To enumerate all substrings of a given string, we enumerate the start and end indices of them. Suppose the start and end indices are `i` and `j`, respectively. Then we have `0<=i<=n` (here end index `j` is exclusive by convention). Thus, using two nested loops with `i` from `0` to `n -1` and `j` from `i + 1` to `n`, we can enumerate all the substrings of `s`.

* To check if one string has duplicate characters, we can use a set. We iterate through all the characters in the string and put them into the `set` one by one. Before putting one character, we check if the set already contains it. If so, we return `false`. After the loop, we return `true`.

Java:
<pre><code>public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++)
                if (allUnique(s, i, j)) ans = Math.max(ans, j - i);
        return ans;
    }

    public boolean allUnique(String s, int start, int end) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
            Character ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (set.contains(ch)) return false;
            set.add(ch);
        }
        return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

#### Complexity Analysis
* Time compiexity: O(n3)
To verify if characters within index range `[i, j)` are all unique, we need to scan all of them. Thus, it costs `O(j - i)` time.

For a given `i`, the sum of time costed by each `j âˆˆ [i+1,n] is]]`
